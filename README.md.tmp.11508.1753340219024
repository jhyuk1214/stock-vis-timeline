# Stock Timeline Value Analysis

A Streamlit web application that visualizes stock price movements with color-coded analysis based on the 200-week moving average. Unlike traditional charts that show static zones, this app dynamically colors the price line based on each time point's position relative to its 200-week moving average.

  - ðŸŸ¢ **Cheap (Green)**: 200W MA â‰¤ Price < 1.5 Ã— 200W MA
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Fair Value (Yellow)**: 1.5 Ã— 200W MA â‰¤ Price < 2.0 Ã— 200W MA
  - ðŸŸ  **Expensive (Orange)**: 2.0 Ã— 200W MA â‰¤ Price < 2.5 Ã— 200W MA
  - ðŸ”´ **Very Expensive (Red)**: Price â‰¥ 2.5 Ã— 200W MA
- **Logarithmic Scale**: Y-axis uses log scale for better visualization of long-term trends
